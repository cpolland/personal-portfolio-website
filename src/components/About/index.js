            Hi, I'm Cody Polland! What gives my life purpose is creating things
            I am passionate about. Whether those things be tangible things or
            digital things. I enjoy the creative process and the satisfaction of
            a finished product. My hobbies include crocheting, illustration,
            photography, sound design, sewing, and many more. I consider myself
            to be an extremely compassionate person and I connect with pretty
            much anyone who wants to connect with me. When I am not coding or
            crafting, you can find me spending time with my boyfriend and my dog
            Riley!
            <br></br>
            <br></br>I am a 29 year old web developer from Denver, Colorado and
            currently living in San Diego, CA. I attended university at Savannah
            College of Art and Design and have my certification in full-stack
            web development from The University of California San Diego UCSD. I
            studied full-stack web-dev but mainly focus on front-end development
            due to my love for design. I am knowledgable of both UI/UX Design. I
            am efficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, WordPress and I am
            familiar with a wide range of programs on the back-end. I love
            learning new programming languages and frame works when need be!
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            If someone were to describe me they would say I am a jack of all
            trades. I thrive best in collaborative work environments and I am
            perseverant when it comes to the success of my team. I have been in
            Web Development for two years and strive to keep expanding my skill
            set.
